python colorCreator.py
```

**Next, request the first color in the gradient:**
```console
Enter the start color (e.g., red, blue):<your color here>
```

**Now, the last color in the gradient:**
```console
Enter the end color (e.g., red, blue):<your color here>
```

**You can then input the gradient.png file as the .png file you want to hear**
